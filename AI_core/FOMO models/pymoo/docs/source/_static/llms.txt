### **Understanding the File Structure**

You've clarified that for each logical documentation page, there are three versions available:

* `.html`: The version displayed to users when Browse the documentation.
* `.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook files, which execute the Markdown content.
* `.md` or `.rst`: The LLM-friendly versions (Markdown or reStructuredText), which are preferred for processing by language models due to their plain-text and structured nature.


This setup ensures that `pymoo` documentation is accessible and usable for both human users and AI systems.
