# Product Overview

pymoo is an open-source Python framework for multi-objective optimization that provides state-of-the-art single and multi-objective algorithms. The framework offers comprehensive features for optimization including:

- Multi-objective optimization algorithms (NSGA-II, NSGA-III, MOEA/D, etc.)
- Single-objective optimization methods
- Visualization tools for optimization results
- Decision making utilities
- Performance indicators and metrics
- Constraint handling mechanisms
- Gradient-based optimization support

The project targets researchers, engineers, and developers working on optimization problems, providing both ease of use for beginners and advanced customization for experts. It's designed to be modular, extensible, and performance-oriented with compiled extensions for speed-critical operations.
